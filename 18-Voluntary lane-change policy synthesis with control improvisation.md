__Safety and incentive for voluntary lane change__\
a lane change maneuver is initiated if it is safe to change to the other lane lane, and the ego car has the incentive to do so. we describe the MOBILE (Minimizing Overall Braking Induced by Lane Changes) model, whose safety and incentive criteria are based on the acceleration of the ego car and its surrounding cars 

We assume that the acceleration ae of the ego vehicle at time t is determined by its speed ve, headway he, and its leader’s speed vf\
ae(t) = fe(ve(t);he(t);vf(t))\
where the headway he = sf − se − l\
Similarly, the acceleration of the neighboring car B (blue) is function fe again.\
incentive criterion requires certain ‘overall benefit’ for performing a lane-change at time t, i.e., eq5 a˜e(t)−ae(t)+ pa˜b(t)−ab(t) > ath
