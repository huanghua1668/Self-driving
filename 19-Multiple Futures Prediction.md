Multiple Futures Predictor (MFP), is a sequential probabilistic latent variable generative model that learns directly from multi-agent trajectory data. 

Motion prediction needs to model the inherently certain future which often contains multiple potential outcomes, due to multiagent interactions and the latent goals of others. 

Agentsâ€™ states do not evolve independently from one another, but rather they interact with each other. 

ability to measure uncertainty by computing probability over likely future trajectories of all agents in closed-form (as opposed to Monte Carlo sampling) is of practical importance.

algorithms are either deterministic, not multimodal, or do not fully capture both past and future interactions.
