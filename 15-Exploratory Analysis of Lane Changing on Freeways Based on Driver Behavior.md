Forty-six research participants drove an instrumented vehicle and performed a combined total of 726 freeway lane changes. Each research participant was categorized into one of four groups ranging from conservative to aggressive based on cluster analysis. 

more conservative drivers have greater lane changing durations than aggressive drivers. The gap acceptance comparison among driver types did not yield any conclusive trend. 

results suggest that driver type impacts freeway lane changing behavior

duration of a lane change is defined in this paper as the time it takes from the point the vehicle first moves laterally until the vehicle is centered in the destination lane. Therefore, the lane changing duration includes the vehicleâ€™s lateral acceleration and final positioning of the vehicle in the destination lane.

Average speed drops at each freeway detector location were used to distinguish between congested and uncongested conditions. Congested conditions were defined when a significant speed drop [i.e., more than 16 km=h (10 mi=h)] sustained for at least 10 min would occur on the freeway.

The degree of congestion affects lane changing operations. Average size of accepted lag gaps is smaller in congested (45.66 ft) conditions than uncongested (87.26 ft) conditions

Different driver types have different lane changing characteristics. Modeling lane changes by incorporating different driver types and driver aggressiveness can better replicate real world conditions. 

Lane changing characteristics appear to be different at different sites, which possibly indicates that lane changing is related to location-specific factors.
