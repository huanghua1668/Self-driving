lane change behavior is deliberate and will experience a lane-changing preparation process for seeking for a suitable acceptable gap or adjusting their velocity before lane-changing execution. Thus, we regard the event during the lane-changing preparation period as a lane-changing execution rejecting event.

After observing abundant trajectories, we find 6s before DLCE starting point belongs to the preparation process for DLCE. Five observations during the 6s are selected uniformly as DLCE rejecting events in this study.
