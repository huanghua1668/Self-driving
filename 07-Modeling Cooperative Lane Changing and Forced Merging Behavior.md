present a combined merging model that has normal, cooperative and forced merging components integrated in a single framework. Parameters of the model have been estimated with detailed vehicle trajectory data collected from Interstate-80, California.

In congested situations, acceptable gaps are often not available and more complex merging phenomena may be observed. For example, drivers may merge through courtesy of the lag driver in the target lane or decide to force in and compel the lag driver to slow down.

If the gaps are not acceptable, the merging vehicle evaluates the speed, acceleration and relative position of the through vehicles and tries to evaluate whether or not the lag driver is providing courtesy to him.
The courtesy or discourtesy of the lag driver 

If the anticipated gap is unacceptable, the driver decides whether to force his way to the mainline compelling the lag driver to slow down or not. This decision can depend on the urgency of the merge, driver characteristics (e.g. risk averseness) and traffic conditions. 

observed lane change (or no change) action at any time instant can be the result of many possible decision sequences that are unobserved.

explicitly consider the anticipatory aspect of cooperation among drivers and aggressive merges by impatient drivers.
