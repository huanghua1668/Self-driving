Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) which models a driver’s binary decision to or not to execute a discretionary lane changing move on freeways. It answers the following question ‘‘Is it time to begin to move into the target lane?” after the driver has decided to change lane and have selected the target lane. 

there are two types of lane change in freeways: mandatory and discretionary. Mandatory lane change is also known as forced or necessary lane change. It usually occurs, in the United States driving convention, when a vehicle is trying to move from the left or center lane to the rightmost lane in order to exit the freeway. Mandatory lane change may also happen when a vehicle has just entered the freeway from an on-ramp and is trying to move to the center or left lane to avoid a downstream exit lane. Mandatory lane change is a microscopic manifestation of the macroscopic route choice behavior. Discretionary lane change is also known as free lane change or desired lane change. It primarily occurs when a driver seeks to increase its speed or seeks a better driving environment (such as greater space ahead or behind his/her vehicle) by moving to an adjacent lane (Caliper, 2011; Zheng, 2014). Obviously, the motivations and resulting driving behavior for the two types of lane change are different. 

the driver actively seeks an opportunity in the target lane to make a lateral move.

Observed Maneuver (OM) was coded as OM = 1 for lane change at t4, and OM = 0 for all other vectors. The observed maneuvers of OM = {0, 1} were used as the ‘‘ground truth” to compare with FIS’s recommendations when evaluating the FIS’s performance.
