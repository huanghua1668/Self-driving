Analyzing the surrounding vehiclesâ€™ mutual effects from their trajectories. 2) Estimating the proper lane change start point and end point according to the analysis of surrounding vehicles. We propose a learning-based approach to understand surrounding traffic and make decisions for a safe lane change

 Takes past trajectories of all related surrounding cars as input to capture mutual interactions and output continuous values to represent behaviors.
 
 the proposed approach is able to generate feasible and human-like lane-change behavior (represented by start and end points) in multi-car environments.
