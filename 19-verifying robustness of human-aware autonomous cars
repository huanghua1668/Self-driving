analyzing the robustness of learning-based control of human-cyber-physical systems.

human models are learned from data, with humans modeled as approximately rational agents optimizing their reward functions.

provide an optimization-driven approach to find small deviations in learned human behavior that lead to violation of safety objectives.

human's true reward function is unknown to the autonomous controller.
