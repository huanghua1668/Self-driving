in the real world, drivers largely will apply small decelerations and will accept smaller time headways for a while, as is shown empirically for merging traffic (10). This phenomenon is known as relaxation

Another important aspect of lane changing is lane change preparation, sometimes referred to as the tactical stage (6), in which drivers may adapt their speed and align with a gap and in which another driver may create a gap. This lane change preparation is referred to as synchronization, as drivers synchronize with an adjacent lane. 

In cooperative lane changes, the potential follower also will start to create a gap by following the potential lane changer. This behavior is also called synchronization and may be triggered for several reasons, such as the use of a turn indicator or the lateral in-lane position. 

Gaps that result in deceleration that is too large are rejected because they are unsafe, uncomfortable, or impolite.
