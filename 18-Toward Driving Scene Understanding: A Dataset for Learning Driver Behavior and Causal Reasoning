need to understand and learn how humans drive and interact with traffic scenes. 

Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD), a challenging dataset to enable research on learning driver behavior in real-life environments. 

detecting unevenly (but naturally) distributed driver behaviors in untrimmed videos is a challenging research problem. Second, interactions between drivers and traffic participants can be explored from cause and effect labels. Third, a multi-task learning framework for learning driving control can be explored. With the predefined driver behavior labels, the annotations can be used as an auxiliary task (i.e., classification of behavior labels) to improve the prediction of future driver actions. Fourth, __a multimodal fusion for driver behavior detection can be studied__

driver-centric view to describe driver behaviors. However, driving involves other aspects. Particularly, it involves __predicting traffic participants’ intentions and reasoning overall traffic situations for motion planning and decision making__

Goal-oriented action involves the driver’s manipulation of the vehicle in a navigation task such as right turn, left turn, branch and merge.
