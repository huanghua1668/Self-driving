Both the utility of a given lane and the risk associated with lane changes are determined in terms of longitudinal accelerations calculated with microscopic traffic models. 

The parameter allows one to vary the motivation for lane changing from purely egoistic to more cooperative driving behavior. 

The modeling of lane changes is typically considered a multistep process. On a strategic level, the driver knows about his or her route in a network, which influences the lane choice, for example, with regard to lane blockages, on-ramps, off-ramps, or other mandatory merges (16). In the tactical stage, an intended lane change is prepared and initiated by advance acceleration or deceleration by the driver and possibly by cooperation of drivers in the target lane (4). Finally, in the operational stage, one determines if an immediate lane change is both safe and desirable (17 ). This choice is typically modeled by the use of gap-acceptance models, in which drivers compare the available gaps to the smallest acceptable gap, or the critical gap. Critical gaps depend in general on the relative speed of the subject vehicle with respect to those of the lead and the lag vehicles in the adjacent lane and on the type of lane change (18). Most lane-changing models in the literature classify lane changes as either mandatory or discretionary.

the braking deceleration imposed on the new follower in the target lane to avoid accidents is an obvious measure for safety. 

motivations for lane changing can be varied from purely egoistic to more altruistic behavior. 

For realistic longitudinal models, bsafe should be well below the maximum possible deceleration  bmax, which is about 9 m/s2 on dry road surfaces. 

MOBIL is meant to represent only the last operational decision of whether to immediately perform a lane change. In reality, a lane-changing decision includes strategical and tactical aspects in preparation for this final step, which are relevant particularly for congested traffic and for mandatory lane changes. For example, tactical behavior may involve accelerations (or decelerations) of the own vehicle or of vehicles in the target lane in preparation for a lane change, which corresponds to active cooperation between the drivers.
