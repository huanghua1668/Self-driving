__Chance constraint__ is defined by the frequency of safety distance violations Vt between EV and TVs over time t = 0 1 , ,f. In particular, the SCMPC controller must guarantee that the safety distance of each EV and TV is not violated in more than a fraction f ! ( , 0 1) of all time steps t = 0 1 , ,f.
