Mobileye paper on Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS)

propose a white-box, interpretable, mathematical model for safety assurance, which we call Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS).  we introduce a model called “Responsibility Sensitive Safety” (RSS) which formalizes an interpretation of “Duty of Care” from Tort law.

a multi-agent system interacts with its environment and thus cannot be validated offline

developing a system through data invariably suffers from lack of transparency, interpretability, and explainability of the actions being taken

RSS is a rigorous mathematical model formalizing an interpretation of the law which is applicable to self-driving cars. RSS is designed to achieve three goals: first, the __interpretation of the law should be sound__ in the sense that it complies with how humans interpret the law. While we are at it we would like also to prove “utopia” — meaning that if all agents follow RSS’s interpretation then there will be zero accidents. Second, the __interpretation should lead to a useful driving policy__, meaning __it will lead to an agile driving policy rather than an overly-defensive driving__ which inevitably would confuse other human drivers and will block traffic and in turn limit the scalability of system deployment; third, the __interpretation should be efficiently verifiable__ in the sense that we can rigorously prove that the self-driving car implements correctly the interpretation of the law.
