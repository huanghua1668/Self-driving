**velocity take average values** The average parameter values from t4-0.4 to t4 (five 0.1 s intervals) were used as the values perceived by the driver at t4. The reasons for taking the average value over 0.5 s are (i) to reduce the error caused by using instantaneous values in the NGSIM data; (ii) to be more consistent with driverâ€™s perception time; and (iii) to be consistent with other research that has used NGSIM data, for example Siuhi and Kaseko (2010).
