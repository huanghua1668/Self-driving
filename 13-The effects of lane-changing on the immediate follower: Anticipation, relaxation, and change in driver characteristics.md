driver characteristics, i.e., changes in driver response time and minimum spacing

transition largely consists of a pre-insertion transition and a relaxation process.the transition process during a LC maneuver. This transition process arises as the (equilibrium) car-following (CF) modes of a lane-changer and the immediate follower are disrupted due to LC and then recovered gradually in time.  Smith (1985) first reported that the transition typically persists for 25 s. 

relaxation phenomenon that arises as a lane-changer (or a follower) initially accepts a short spacing upon a maneuver and then gradually returns (relaxes) to a normal spacing given the speed.  transition begins while the lane-changer initiates a maneuver in the original lane. We refer to this as an ‘‘anticipation’’ period in this paper. 

Based on Ma and Ahn (2008)’s preliminary finding that the impact of LC normally lasts less than 30 s

provide a method to systematically identify different components of LC impacts: (i) anticipation process, (ii) relaxation process, and (iii) change in driver characteristics induced by LC. Using the NGSIM vehicle trajectories, we found that the average durations for the anticipation and relaxation processes respectively range 8–14 s and 10–15 s,
