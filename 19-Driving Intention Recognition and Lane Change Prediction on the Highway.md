prediction of other vehicles’ future behavior is required for automated cars to make a right decision under the mixed traffic conditions where human-driven and automated cars are on the same road. 

a driving behavior predictor. A driver’s implicit driving characteristic information is uniquely determined and detected by proposed the online-estimator.
two IDM parameters, at and Tt, and two incentives, It lcl and I lcr t , are considered as longitudinal and lateral driving characteristics. The recent past three-seconds data with 0.1 seconds unit-time is stored into the memory for estimation of the driving characteristics. 

a variance based sensitivity analysis is performed on the IDM using NGSIM data, which is the same data source as in this study, and it is discovered that only three IDM parameters are of critical influence when approximating real-world driving motion with IDM. The three most influential parameters are desired safety time headway T , IDM order coefficient δ, and desired acceleration a. Furthermore, the sensitivity significance of desired time headway T is significantly larger than the other two.

the pattern of an identical behavior is various depending on traffic conditions.
