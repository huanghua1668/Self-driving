learning human decision-making experience in driving

For each vehicle, the two-dimensional positions (longitudinal and lateral position) of the closest preceding and following vehicles within detection region in the current lane and adjacent lanes are extracted from NGSIM dataset. the two-dimensional positions of subject vehicle in the following time steps are predicted.

1230 vehiclesâ€™ trajectories are obtained (including 200 LCs and more than 800,000 CF samples), where 2/3 of data are used for training and the rest 1/3 of data are used for testing. On the other hand, although the NGSIM dataset contain all sorts of inconsistencies and errors, the main issues are within the speed and acceleration data which are not used in this study
